### Hi there

Read to learn more about me, + Goals of mine. 
-  Originally from Morris County, New Jersey. Moved down to Charlotte, NC for some great opportunites.
- ðŸ’¬ Began coding in 2019, quickly fell in love and had a burning desire to create amazing web applications to expand the way people interact with software and applications.

### Story time
âœ” I knew I had a love for developing software when I was tasked with creating business metrics for a company in Excel. I was writing functions, conditionals, and displaying client data information. The metrics were company-client based to keep track of subscriptions, internal department performance (with graphs), leads, and more! I created an interconnected 10-page spreadsheet that my company uses as a CRM still to this day. I'm excited to have the opportunity to create real software, User-Interfaces, and Back-Ends that companies can use. Send me an email if you want to chat!  

### Goals of mine
- ðŸ”­ Innovation is always on my mind. An example of an idea I would have loved to work with would have been Paypal. They started as a 'super-bank' of financial services, but the consumers had a different idea. They mainly loved the ability to email payments! From this and many more examples, I gained knowledge on adapting to the customer to create a great platform/product/service.
- âš¡ I will never stop advancing to come across the next innovative stepping stone in this world. I aspire to work with a company to help!
