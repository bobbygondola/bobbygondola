### Hi there

Read to learn more about me, + Goals of mine. 
-  Originally from Morris County, New Jersey. Moved down to Charlotte, NC for some great opportunites.
- ðŸ’¬ Began coding in 2019, quickly fell in love and had a burning desire to create amazing web applications to expand the technologies we use.

### Goals of mine
- ðŸ”­ Innovation is always on my mind, an example of an idea I would have loved to work with would be Paypal. They started as a 'super-bank' of financial services but the consumers had a different idea, they just loved the ability to email money! From this and many more examples I gained knowledge on adapting to the customer to create a great platform/product/service.
- âš¡ I will never stop advancing to come across the next innovative stepping stone in this world, and I aspire to work with a company to help!
