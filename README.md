### Intro
Hey there, I'm Robert Gondola from Charlotte, NC. I'm an ambitious Software Developer who is aspiring to work with a company with a high speed, future-driven culture.

I started my career in 2017 when I fell in love with creating CRM-like spreadsheets for companies. In 2019 I was tasked to engineer a large Information System spreadsheet to track internal department performance and external client data. The resulting product allowed for the company to view growth rates (In multiple aspects), department performance, conversion rates, and more! The CEO was so happy with the product that they uses that CRM-like spreadsheet to this day.

This experience lead me to love working with data to create rich, data-driven software!

I now develop deep, intricate web software with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Redux, Node, Express, Python, Databases, and host most of my code repositories on Github. If tasked with an idea, as an engineer, my job to implement technologies to solve that problem.

Whether I'm tasked to build an admin section for an e-commerce platform, pulling and displaying data from various APIs on analytical dashboards, or simply creating a company's online web application. I base my confidence in my ability to learn. If you know how to learn, you do just about anything.
