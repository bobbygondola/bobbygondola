### Hi there

Read About Me, A Full Stack Dev 
- ðŸ‘‹ Originally from Morris County, New Jersey. Moved down to Charlotte, NC for some great opportunites.
- ðŸ’¬ Began coding in 2019, quickly fell in love and had a burning desire to create amazing web applications to expand the technologies we use.
- ðŸ”­ Innovation is always on my mind, an example of an idea i would have loved to work with would be Paypal. They started as a 'super-bank' of financial services but the consumers had a different idea, they just loved the ability to email money! From this and many more examples i gained knowledge on adapting to the customer to create a great platform/product/service.
- âš¡ I aspire to come across the next innovative stepping stone in this world, and aspire to work with a company to help!
