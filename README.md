I develop deep, intricate web software with JavaScript, Java, Python, React, HTML, CSS, Redux, Node, Express, and more. Confident in completing any task or idea using powerful philosophies and technologies to back them.

Whether I'm tasked to build an admin section for an e-commerce platform, pulling and displaying data from various APIs to build analytical dashboards, or simply creating a company's online web application. I base my confidence in my ability to learn. With the skill of learning, you can do anything.
